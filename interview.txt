	-> Image formate is depend on requirements, if we want transparent backgound than we must use png image, Otherwise we used jpg formate because it has smaller size than png

	->SVG:(Scalable Vector Graphics)

		SVG supports animation, transparency, gradients, and is easily scalable without losing quality. 

11) What is the use of Doctype?
	
	->Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration. It informs the web browser about the type and version of HTML

12) What are the different meta tag and which mete tag used to make page responsive?

27) What is DOM?
	
	What is DOM:-
	->When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a *DOM* of the page and In that elements are organized as a tree structure.
	->the DOM is just another way to represent your HTML document

	where D = Document (means aapdu aakhu html page),
		  O = Object (body,head,main,etc. aa bdha tag),
		  M = Modal ()

	What is virtual DOM:-
		->A virtual DOM only look at the differences between the previous and current HTML and changes the par that required to be updated.(meand HTML ma koi changes karsu to dom aakhu nvu ny bane..just j changes karya hse tya j update karse)
		->It updates faster.
		->Can’t directly update HTML
		->Updates the JSX if element updates
		->DOM manipulation is very easy
		->No memory wastage

	What is real DOM:-
		->This will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the data to be updated(means koi ek jagyaye change karyo hse to aakhu dom tree pelethi banse)
		->It updates slow
		->Can directly update HTML
		->Creates a new DOM if element updates
		->DOM manipulation is very expensive
		->Too much of memory wastage

28) What is DOM traversing?
	
	-> DOM traversing means "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. 
	-> It Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.

30) HTML vs DHTML
	
	-> https://www.javatpoint.com/dhtml

31) UI developer vs html developer
	
	-> An HTML or web developer's job is to convert PSD to HTML and it has less interactivity with functionality.
	-> A UI developer job is also to convert PSD to HTML but it has also responsible for its functionality(like: animations, dynamic websites, frontend tools like angular, react).

	-> Front-end developer builds websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other common client side technologies.
	-> UI-Developer Similarly uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other client side technologies. There is less emphasis on scripting languages like JavaScript and more emphasis on HTML and CSS


32) Table grid
	
	-> https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp

33) slick all options..customm arrows

34) flex advantages and flex vs floats
	
	-> https://code.likeagirl.io/css-layouts-understanding-the-differences-between-grid-flex-and-float-1d6ed96d3182


35) <meta charset="UTF-8">
	
	-> The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.

	-> The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

36) jquery : 3.6.0
    slick: 1.8.1
    bootstrap: 5.1.3

37) <link rel="" />
	
	-> The rel attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document.
	-> Valid on <link>, <a>, <area>, and <form>

38) target in <a>
	
	-> _blank	   Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
	   _self	   Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default)
	   _parent	   Opens the linked document in the parent frame
	   _top	       Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
	   framename   Opens the linked document in the named iframe

		box-shadow.
		text-shadow.
		text-overflow: ellipsis
		Flexible Box Model.

2) Difference between display block and inline-block and inline
	
	->display: inline-block, Does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
	->display: block, Add a line-break after the element. It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width
	->display: inline, Any height and width properties will have no effect. and if we apply padding/margin then it reflect only for left/right not for top/bottom.

3) How you make table responsive? 
	
	-> There is two way to make table responsive

		1. Wrap table in div element and give overflow-x: auto to that div element.
		2. Using data-* attribute

		https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/MyqmdM

4) what is responsive web design and what are the standard breakpoints?

		>=1200px
		>=1400px

5) What is sass and less?
	
	-> Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass) and Leaner CSS (LESS) are both CSS preprocessors.
	They are special stylesheet extensions that make designing easier and more efficient. Both Sass and LESS compile into CSS stylesheets so that browsers can read them.

	-> scss is a syntax extension for sass and 

	-> The only difference I found between sass and less is:
		SASS is based on Ruby, while LESS uses JavaScript
		Sass uses $ for variables whereas less uses @

6) What is mixin?
	
	-> Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.
	eg.- 
		@mixin scale($scale) {
		    -moz-transform: scale($scale);
		    -o-transform: scale($scale);
		    -ms-transform: scale($scale);
		    -webkit-transform: scale($scale);
		    transform: scale($scale);
		}

		use: @include scale(1.5);

		@mixin transition($transition) {
		    transition: $transition;
		    -o-transition: $transition;
		    -ms-transition: $transition;
		    -webkit-transition: $transition;
		    -moz-transition: $transition;
		}

		use: @include transition(all 0.3s);

	Difference between mixin and extend:

		Custom SVG icon library

8) Difference between margin and padding
	
	-> The outer space of an element i.e. margin is the space outside the border. 
	   The inner space of an element i.e. padding is space inside the element's border

9) Which method we used to load custom fonts
	
	-> @font-face

	@font-face {
	  font-family: "Open Sans";
	  src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2"),
	       url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff") format("woff");
	}


jQuery : 

1) What is the difference between ready and load?
	
	-> onload function will run once the entire page(images, iframes, stylesheets,etc) are loaded.
	-> ready event fires before all images,iframes etc. are loaded, but after the whole DOM itself is ready.

2) At where do you include js file in html?
	
	-> We can add a js file in HTML whereas we like, but we know that html follow top to bottom approach so it is best practice to add js file before body closing tag.

3) List the event or methods of jQuery.
	
	-> click, mouseenter, mouseleave, keyup, keydown, etc.

4) What is a different between on click and click event?

	-> click events only work when element gets rendered and are only attached to elements loaded when the DOM is ready. 
	-> on events are dynamically attached to DOM elements, which is helpful when you want to attach an event to DOM elements that are rendered on ajax request or something else (after the DOM is ready)

5) What is jQuery?
	
	-> jQuery is a JavaScript library.
	-> Using it's shorter synatx we can easily Travers DOM tree, make css animation and also easily handle events.

4) What is the correct way to check how many paragraphs exist on a page using jQuery?
	
	-> $('p').length

5) Why it is better to use Jquery instead of $
	
	-> As we already know jQuery uses the $ sign as a shortcut for jQuery.
  	-> There are many other popular JavaScript frameworks like: Angular, Backbone, Ember, Knockout, and more which are also used $ sign as a shortcut.
  	-> So, it is better to use jQuery instead of $ to avoid conflicts.

  	$.noConflict();
	jQuery(document).ready(function(){
	  jQuery("button").click(function(){
	    jQuery("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
	  });
	});

	or

	var jq = $.noConflict();
	jq(document).ready(function(){
	  jq("button").click(function(){
	    jq("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
	  });
	});

7) parent vs parents vs closest

	-> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-the-difference-between-closest-and-parents-methods-in-jQuery


Javascript:

$(document).keydown(function (event) {
    if (event.keyCode == 123) { // Prevent F12
        return false;
    } else if (event.ctrlKey && event.shiftKey && event.keyCode == 73) { // Prevent Ctrl+Shift+I        
        return false;
    }
});
Prevent Right Click > Inspect Element

$(document).on("contextmenu", function (e) {        
    e.preventDefault();
});

  // running car
$('.running-vehicles-block').slick({
 speed: 5000,

 scrub:true


0) Javascript Book 
	
1) What is JavaScript?
	
	-> JavaScript is a scripting language. It Adds the *behaviour and interactivity* of your webpage.

2) Scripting && Programming && Markup Language :
	
	=> Scripting language : 
		->Scripting languages are mostly used in web applications.
		->Compilation is not required. That's why it run faster.
		->Scripting languages can be divided into two categories:
		 	->Server side scripting languages are: JavaScript, PHP etc. 
		 	->Client side scripting languages are: JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery etc.
		->All scripting languages are programming language

	=> Programming language : 
		->Is main language, used to create a software.
			ex.- Java,C,C++,etc.
		->All programming languages are not scripting language.
		->Compilation is required.

	=> Markup language : 
		->It used to Create a data structure or website structure.
			ex.- HTML,xml.

React: 17.0.2 (3000:port)

	-> I have done one projects in React called Wymap.
	-> In this project my responsibilities is to design user interface(UI) using material ui theme.

	https://www.wymap.com.au/#about

	1) Project Name: Wymap

    Responsibilities: In this project, I have designed a customer portal as well as an admin portal.

    Project Description: Basically, this site is used for the transportation and shipment of goods via an air carrier


Material UI theme:
	
	-> 


1) What is React?

	->React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011.
	->It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.
	->It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.

2) What are the features of React? 

	->Major features of React are listed below:

	1. It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.
	2. It uses server-side rendering.
	3. It follows uni-directional data flow or data binding.

3) What is JSX?

	->JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML. 
	->JSX is an HTML-like syntax that let’s developers write HTML style code in JavaScript
	->Below is an example of JSX:

	render(){
	    return(        
			<div>
				<h1> Hello World from Edureka!!</h1>
	        </div>
	    );
	}

4) Why can’t browsers read JSX?
	
	->Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.

5) What is component in React?
	
	->A Component is one of the core building blocks of React.
	->In react everythings is based on components. 
	->Components in React basically return a piece of JSX code that tells what should be rendered on the screen. 

6) What is the purpose of render() function in react.js?
	
	->Render function in react is used to return the HTML you want to display in a component.

	import React from 'react' 
 
	export default function App(){
	   render (){ 
	      return ( 
	         <h1>Hello</h1> 
	      ) 
	   } 
	} 

	->Every Render function contains a return statement

7) WHAT’S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROPS AND STATE?
	
	-> “State” describes a default data value in a React component that can change over time (usually based on user actions that call for changes in a UI).

	-> “Props” (or properties) describe the way a React component is configured.
	-> Props do not change.
	-> React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties). Props are basically kind of global variable or object.

		ex.-

			import React from 'react';
			import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

			export default function DemoComponent(){
			    render(){
			        return(
			                <div>
			                    {/*accessing information from props */}
			                    <h2>Hello {this.props.user}</h2>
			                </div>
			            );
			    }
			}
			 
			ReactDOM.render(
			    // passing props
			    <DemoComponent user = "Alpesh Baraiya" />,
			    document.getElementById("root")
			);

			o/p: - Hello Alpesh Baraiya

8) What are the advantages of React?
	
	->Increased application performance via the Virtual DOM model
	->Improved coding efficiency with JSX
	->The ability to reuse components across multiple projects

9) What are the limitations of React?
	
	->React only focus on the view part of MVC i.e. UI of the web application
	->Poor Documentation


Angular: 12.2.8 (4200:port)

	-> Honestly, I worked on angular as a web developer. So, I haven't chance to practice those things so I only know that all the things in a theoretical way.

	-> Actually sir I have worked on 2 project on angular and in both of that project my responsibility is only to Design is UI from the given PSD. so, I haven't get chance to learn about api and backend stuffs.
	
	-> I have did one project in Angular
	-> In this project my responsibilities is to design user interface(UI) using Angular material theme.

	1) Project Name: MutahMarriage

    Responsibilities: In this project, I have designed a customer portal.

    Project Description: Basically, It's a matrimonial site for Shia Muslims.

0) What is new in Angular 12?
	
	-> https://www.infoworld.com/article/3607428/whats-new-in-angular-12.html
	
1) What is Angular and Why Angular?
	
	->Angular is not a programming language like Javascript or Typescript. 
	->Angular is a front-end or client-side Framework, which needs a programming language like Typescript. 
	->Angular is a client-side framework. It means that it runs on the client-side or user's browser and not on a Web Server (like java/python/ruby/vb.net run). 

	->	VERSION	 STATUS	  RELEASED	     ACTIVE ENDS	  LTS ENDS
	    ^12.0.0	 Active	 May 12, 2021	Nov 12, 2021	Nov 12, 2022

2) Name the building blocks of Angular.

	-> The Angular application is made using the following: 

		Modules

		Component

		Template

		Directives

		Data Binding

		Services

		Dependency Injection

		Routing

3) Differentiate between Components and Directives in Angular.
	
	->Components break up the application into smaller parts; whereas, Directives add behavior to an existing DOM element. 

4) What is the use of @Input and @Output? 
	
	->When it comes to the communication of Angular Components, which are in Parent-Child Relationship; we use @Input in Child Component when we are passing data from Parent to Child Component and @Output is used in Child Component to receive an event from Child to Parent Component. 

5) What is Routing in Angular 5?
	
	->Routing helps a user in navigating to different pages using links.

6) Explain the usage of {{}}?
	
	->It represent data from a component
	->It's call interpolation

7) In how many ways the Data Binding can be done?

	->Data Binding happens between the HTML (template) and typescript (component). Data binding can be done in 3 ways:

	(i) Property Binding (ii) Event Binding (iii) Two-Way Data Binding. 

8) How is SPA (Single Page Application) technology different from the traditional web technology?
	
	-> In traditional web technology The problem here is a lot of time is consumed in the requesting/responding or due to a lot of reloading.
	->Whereas, in the SPA technology, we maintain only one page (index.HTML) even though the URL keeps on changing. 

9)  What is Component in Angular Terminology? 

	->A web page in Angular has many components involved in it. A Component is basically a block in which the data can be displayed on HTML using some logic usually written in typescript.
