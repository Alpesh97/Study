note:-	
	In HTML 4.x we need to write *type* attribute in *script* and *style* tag.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript :

=> HTML :
	Control the *structure* of your webpage.

=> CSS :
	Control the *presentation/design* of your webpage.

=> JavaScript :
	Adds *behaviour and interactivity* of your webpage.


* Javascript vs Javascript Library *


Compiler/Interpreter :
	
=> Compiler:
	->	


=> Interpreter:
	->


Scripting && Programming && Markup Language :
	
=> Scripting language : 
	->Is used to connect one language with another language
		ex.- PHP,JavaScript
	->All scripting languages are programming language
	->Compolation is not required. That's why it run faster.

=> Programming language : 
	->Is main language, used to create a software.
		ex.- Java,C,C++,etc.
	->All programming languages are not scripting language.
	->Compolation is required.

=> Markup language : 
	->It used to Create a data structure or website structure.
		ex.- HTML,xml.


=> Data Types:

    10 + "20" = 1020
    9 - "4" = 5 // bug
    " " + " " + 1 = "  1"
    " " + " " = "  "
    " " - " " = 0
    "alpesh" - "baraiya" = NaN
    true + true = 2 // true = 1, false = 0
    false - true = -1


=> null vs undefine:    

    -> null means nothing (empty).
    ex. - var test = null;
          console.log(test);
          console.log(typeof(test));

            o/p : null
                  object //bug

    -> undefine means variable is defined but value is not assigned.
    ex. - var test;
          console.log(test);
          console.log(typeof(test));

            o/p : undefine
                  undefine

=> What is NaN? (Not a Number)

    -> When we try to substact two strings than it return NaN.
    -> It is a property of the global object. OR It is a variable in global scope.
    -> we can also use it as a condition

        ex : var test = "Alpesh";
        
            if(isNaN(test)){
                console.log('valid');
            }
            else{
                console.log('not valid');
            }

            o/p : valid

    -> NaN == NaN : false // because we don't know what is for NaN(Not A Number but kono?)
    -> NaN === NaN : false
    -> Number.NaN === NaN : false
    -> Number.NaN == NaN : false
    -> console.log(isNaN(NaN)) : true
    -> console.log(isNaN(Number.NaN)) : true


=> Expression and Operators:

    -> Expression : The combination of operator and Operands is called Expression.

        ex.  10 + 5    where 10,5 are Operands
                              + is a operator
    
    -> Operators : There are many types of operators:

        1) Assignment operator : It assign a value to it's left operand based on the value of it's right operand,

            ex.  x = 5;

        2) Arithmetic operator : It takes a numeric value and return a single numerical value.  

            -> Used for perform a Arithmetic operations (addition, substaction, multiplication, division)
        
        3) Increment and Decrement operator: x++ OR ++x OR x-- OR --x

            -> Postfix increment:

            let x = 3;
            y = x++;

            // y = 3
            // x = 4

            -> Prefix increment:

            let x = 3;
            y = ++x;

            // y = 3
            // x = 3

        4) Comparision operator: It simply use for comparision

            -> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp

        5) Logical operator : It used with Boolean(logical) value.

            -> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp

        
        -> exercise:    

            1) 3**5 = 243 (3*3*3*3*3)
            2) 10**-1 = 0.1 (1/10)
            3) 5 - "alpesh" = NaN

            4) swap two number program:

                var a = 5,
                    b = 10;

                var c = b // c = 10
                    b = a // b = 5
                    a = c // a = 10
            
            5) swap two number program without using third variable:

                var a = 5,
                    b = 10;

                    a = a + b // a = 15
                    b = a - b // a = 5
                    a = a - b // a = 10


=> Control statements and loops:

    1) if and else: 

        -> If the condition is true than if block will be executed and if the condition is false than else block is executed.

        -> write a program to find the given year is leap year or not?

            var year = 2020;    
            
            if(year % 4  === 0) {
                if(year % 100  === 0) {
                    if(year % 400  === 0) {
                        console.log('This is Leap Year');
                    }
                    else{
                        console.log('Not a Leap Year');
                    }
                }
                else{
                    console.log('This is Leap Year');
                }
            }
            else{
                console.log('Not a Leap Year');
            }

    2) In javascript there are 5 falsy value  : 0(false), "", undefine, null, NaN

        if(0 || "" || undefine || null || NaN){  OR if(test = 0 || test = "" || test = undefine || test = null || test = NaN
            console.log('if');
        }
        else{
            console.log('else');
        }

        o/p : else


        if(scope = 5){
            console.log('if')
        }
        else{
            console.log('else')
        }

        o/p : if

    3) ternary(Conditional) operator: It's an only operator that takes three operands

        -> basically it's a shorter version of if..else block

        -> sybtax : variable_name = (condition) ? value1 : value2

    4) loops:   

        i) while : that perticular statement executes untill the condition evaluates to true.

            -> It firstly check the condition and if it is true then and then it goes into it's block.
            -> It is block scope.

        ex. var num = 0;
            while(num < 10){
                console.log(num);
                num++;
            }

            o/p :   0
                    1
                    2
                    3
                    4
                    5
                    6
                    7
                    8
                    9

        ii) Do-While  : 

        -> It firstly execute the do block then check the condition and if it is true then it again to the the do block and cycle repeat.
        -> It is block scope.

        ex. var num = 0;

            do{
                console.log(num);
                num++;
            }while(num < 10);

            o/p :   0
                    1
                    2
                    3
                    4
                    5
                    6
                    7
                    8
                    9

           iii) for :   

           -> syntax: for(initializer; condition; iteration) {
                        // code
                      }
            -> It firstly check the condition and if it is true then and then it goes into it's block.
            -> It is block scope.
            -> At the time of for loop run it visit to the initializer only first time.

            ex. for(var num = 0; num < 10; num++) {
                    console.log(num);
                }

                o/p :   0
                        1
                        2
                        3
                        4
                        5
                        6
                        7
                        8
                        9

            -> For vs While:    

                ->In general, you should use a for loop when you know how many times the loop should run. 
                ->If you want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs, you should use a while loop.

            -> exercise : 

                i) write a program to print the table of given number.

                    var num = 8;
                    for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i ++){
                        console.log(num + "*" + i + "=" + (num * i));
                    }


=> Function:    

    ->https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp

    ex. function sum(a, b){      where a,b are called the parameters
            var total = a + b;
            console.log(total);
        }

        sum();
        sum(10,25);  where 10,25 are called the arguments

        o/p : NaN
              35

    -> Function Expressions: means create a function and put into the variable.

        ex. function sum(a, b){
            var total = a + b;
            console.log(total);
        }

        var funExp = sum(10,25);  

    -> but function expressions are incomplete without return statement.

    -> Return Keyword : when javascript reaches a return statement, the function will stop execution.

        -> return value is return back to the "caller".

            ex. function sum(a, b){
                    return total = a + b;
                }

                var funExp = sum(10,25); 
                console.log(funExp);
                
                so we can easy put that varibale in any place like: console.log('the sum is: ' + funExp);

                o/p : 35
                      the sum is: 35

    -> Anonymous Function: function without a name is called a Anonymous function.  

        -> Is same as a function expression but it's an another way to describe it.

            ex. var funExp = function(a, b){
                    return total = a + b;
                }                                                       where : function(a, b){
                var sum = funExp(4, 16);                                           return total = a + b;
                console.log('the sum is' + sum);                                } is called the Anonymous function.

                o/p : 20
                      the sum is: 20

=> ES6 (EcmaScript 2015):

    -> var vs let vs const: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp

    -> Template literals (Template String): https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp

    -> Default parameters : 

        -> In our function if sometime user forgot to enter some arguments or we want to perform some operations with our default arguments than 
        we can use Default parameters in our function.

        ex. function sum(a,b = 5){
                return a + b; 
            }

            console.log(sum(3));    // If we pass only one argument in our function then it automatically assign to the first parameters.

            o/p: 8
